## OAuth 2.0 and OIDC with Okta

If you don't have a free Okta developer account, you can create one with [the Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com):

```bash
$ okta register
```

Then, register your Spring Boot app on Okta using:

```bash
$ okta apps create
```

Select **Web** > **Okta Spring Boot Starter** and accept the default redirect URIs.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
